## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Pre-Action Analysis
Before each action, the system:
- Calculates current risk factors
- Determines optimal delay
- Selects the best account
- Checks safety thresholds

### 2. Action Execution
During each action:
- Simulates human behavior
- Records action for analysis
- Updates safety metrics
- Monitors for warnings

### 3. Post-Action Processing
After each action:
- Updates account statistics
- Adjusts risk factors
- Schedules next actions
- Plans breaks if needed

## üîß Configuration

### Safety Level Selection
```bash
# Conservative (Safest)
curl -X POST /api/anti-detection/safety-level \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"level": "conservative"}'

# Balanced (Recommended)
curl -X POST /api/anti-detection/safety-level \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"level": "balanced"}'

# Aggressive (Fastest)
curl -X POST /api/anti-detection/safety-level \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"level": "aggressive"}'
```

### Account Management
```bash
# Pause account for safety
curl -X POST /api/anti-detection/pause-account/ACCOUNT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Resume account
curl -X POST /api/anti-detection/resume-account/ACCOUNT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Check account safety
curl -X GET /api/anti-detection/account-safety/ACCOUNT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## üìà Monitoring Dashboard

The anti-detection dashboard provides real-time monitoring:

### Safety Score
- **95-100**: Excellent - Continue normally
- **85-94**: Good - Monitor closely
- **70-84**: Caution - Reduce activity
- **50-69**: Warning - Take breaks
- **0-49**: Critical - Pause immediately

### Key Metrics
- **Actions Today**: Current daily action count
- **Next Break**: When next break will occur
- **Risk Factor**: Current risk multiplier
- **Account Priority**: Which account is safest to use

## üö® Safety Alerts

The system automatically alerts you to:

### High-Risk Situations
- Too many actions in short time
- Unusual activity patterns
- Account age too new
- Low follower count
- Consecutive failures

### Automatic Responses
